## Install Python 3
Install Python3 with Brew
Enter brew command into terminal

`brew install python3`

## Optional PATH
Set up PATH environment variable, if you used HomeBrew to install Python3, then HomeBrew already added PATH.

Do not change PATH environment if you can launch python3 from terminal.

Add the following line to your `~/.profile` file

`export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH`

Usually your Python installation directory looks like this, add it to your PATH

`PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:${PATH}"`
